# This project is not hosted on Microsoft GitHub anymore

**You can still find it at the [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~groctel) link in the project description.**

## Why did you remove your code from GitHub?

GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not free software.
I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop my free software project, as I believe that free software projects should be hosted in free software forges.
I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host free software.

## I do not consent for my code to be used by GitHub Copilot

Any use of my projects' code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.
